This week I made a Wifi scanner using ESP8266. I am currently implementing it to map RSSI of various routers on the college floor. I expect this heat map can then be used to extract indoor position via nearest neighbor mapping of RSSI.

The backend server gets location as mouse X and Y coordinated on a mousePress event. This can readily be converted to indoor location or mapped to the same map without needing to triangulate.
